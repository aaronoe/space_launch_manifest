# Space Launch Manifest

Android app which tracks rocket launches using a public API provided by http://launchlibrary.net/.

## Purpose

I created this app as a private project, to gain a deeper understanding of creating android applications. Therefore the sole
purpose of this app is to teach myself android development. On a different note, this app was heavily 
inspired by https://github.com/caman9119/SpaceLaunchNow.

Even though this app looks very similar to SpaceLaunchNow, I did not copy any code.
